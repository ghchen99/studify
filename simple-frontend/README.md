# Simple Frontend

Quick bootstrap for the MSAL + FastAPI demo.

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd simple-frontend
npm install
```

Start frontend (webpack dev server):

```bash
npm start
```

Make sure the backend FastAPI (main.py) is running on port 8000.

Update `authConfig.ts` with your `clientId` and `authority` before testing.
