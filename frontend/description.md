Learning Platform – Frontend Trigger & Workflow Documentation

This document describes how users interact with the platform via frontend buttons, and which API calls are triggered at each stage.
The system follows a progressive learning workflow:

Generate a lesson plan

Approve the plan

Start individual lessons

Expand lesson sections on demand

Complete lessons

Take quizzes

Receive tutoring if needed

View progress in dashboard

IDs (lessonPlanId, lessonId, quizId, etc.) are generated by the backend and must be stored in frontend state once returned.

Mastery breakdown

ID Flow Summary (Frontend Mental Model)
Generated By	ID	Used For
Lesson Plan creation	lesson_plan_id	Starting lessons
Lesson start	lesson_id	Expanding sections, completing lesson, quizzes
Quiz start	quiz_id	Submitting answers
Tutor start	session_id	Chat messages
Key Frontend Principles

IDs must be stored in state once returned

No endpoint is called automatically except dashboard fetch

Content generation is lazy and on-demand

Buttons map directly to API calls

Tutor is optional and conditional
