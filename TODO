Frontend Bug Fixes
- POlling API response, something to show loading and waiting for generation
- Quiz changed a few seconds after rendering
- Course view is good but maybe need to click into course view page with lessons and a tracker instead of all on homepage, logos and imgs for subjects
- home page too minimalist, maybe carousel courses, with images.
